Why brands become publishers

# {.step .slide data-x=1000 daty-y=-2000 data-z=-2000}

We live in a society in which we are increasingly connected by digital technology. In this society the public sphere is no longer produced by the mass media. More and more economic processes are happening publicly and in a networked way. Whoever is participating in society is produces content about themselves and about everything they are doing and is perceived via this content.

Content strategy is nothing else than a strategic approach to this content. Content marketing means to use this content in a targeted way for marketing purposes. Brands are perceived via content because they are acting today in a networked way, publicly and in realtime.

> The era of one-way, single-threaded, brand-directed mass communications is officially over. ... The only way to reach your audience in today’s information-drenched, content-saturated world is through Epic Content Marketing that emotionally connects with the people you are trying to reach." (@pulizzi2013a, loc. 96-104)

# Nielsen/Inpowered: {.step .slide data-y=2000 data-x=3000}

> Overall, our research suggests that there is a higher degree of trust from consumers when they are reading content from credible, third party experts. This trust is demonstrated by the higher lift scores with regard to product familiarity, affinity and purchase intent and its perception of being highly informative and unbiased. This level of trust further suggests that expert content is more efficient at pushing consumers along the consumer decision-making process because it is more effective at consistently lifting these measures across each phase of the purchase process. While expert content was impactful across product categories, its impact seems to be even more pronounced with higherpriced items.

Your customers don’t care about you, your products, or your services. They care about themselves (Joe Pulizzi)

# Thesen:  {.step .slide  data-x=6000 data-y=-1000 data-z=-1000}
1. Brands today have different and by far more touch points with customers than they used to have. On the other site they are losing the traditional media channels controlled by their budget in a quasi monopolistic way.

# Thesen:  {.step .slide  data-x=6000 data-y=-1000 data-z=-2000}

2. Control of the digital touchpoints has been transferred to the customers.

# Thesen:  {.step .slide  data-x=6000 data-y=-1000 data-z=-3000}

3. The value propositions of brands are getting more complex and more networked. Brands are perceived as parts of a media world. The value proposition of a brand has become more complex and more networked.

# Thesen:  {.step .slide  data-x=6000 data-y=-1000 data-z=-4000}

4. For these reasons a brand's value proposition is integrated into complex content offerings. Content provides opportunities for continuous interaction from raising awareness to consolidating loyality.

# Thesen:  {.step .slide  data-x=6000 data-y=-1000 data-z=-5000}

5. Only radically user centered content marketing provides the chance to reach customers in a manner not limited to isolated contacts and interactions.
